### SYNTAX
 - deleted some unnecessary spaces

### STRUCTURE
 - little syntax, only console.log. but ok i guess.

### PREDICTION
 - if i would change the number 6 in line 22 to 10 it would give me a number between 1 and 10 

### CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING
 - Math.random gives you a random number between 0 and 1 which i multiply by 6 and add 1 to be able to round it down.
